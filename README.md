# chip-seq

Chromatin immunoprecipitation is a technique that studies protein-DNA interaction. Proteins are cross-linked to the DNA sequences they are bound to and the DNA is then fragmented. Antibodies are used to pull down the protein that bring down the sequences cross-linked with it. The cross-link is digested and the DNA fragments associated with the protein of interest are sequenced. 

This can be used to study binding targets of transcriotion factors, changes in binding patterns upon mutations in the protein of interest, etc.
